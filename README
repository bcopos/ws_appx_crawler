Windows Phone Store Appx Apps Crawler

Crawler that gathers links for .appx Apps from Windows Phone Store (to download apps, 'click' on links and it will automatically download app)

To run:
`scrapy crawl appx -a [/path/and/name_of_output_file]`

How?

Bing search engine indexes Windows Phone Store, making it easy to find appx applications by using the following query string:
`site:windowsphone.com AppxManifest.xml`

The crawler gets all the links resulting from the above query and downloads the application package found at that location
