Windows Phone Store Appx Apps Crawler
===============

Crawler that gathers links for .appx Apps from Windows Phone Store (to download apps, 'click' on links and it will automatically download app)

How?
-----

Bing search engine indexes Windows Phone Store, making it easy to find appx applications by using the following query string:
`site:windowsphone.com AppxManifest.xml`

The crawler gets all the links resulting from the above query and downloads the application package found at that location


ToDo
---

- add mongodb to store links
- add random sleep to avoid detection (poor but should be enough) 


Dependencies
-------

- scrapy
- pymongo (will add soon)
